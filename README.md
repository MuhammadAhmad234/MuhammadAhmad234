### 👨‍💻 Technical Profile

I am a Software Engineer specializing in the intersection of **High-Performance Backend Architecture** and **Artificial Intelligence**.

Currently, I work as a **Backend & AI Engineer at Speecto**, where I engineer robust server-side solutions and integrate next-generation AI agents. My core expertise lies in building type-safe, encrypted systems and developing autonomous agents using the **ReAct (Reasoning + Acting)** paradigm.

I focus on writing clean, maintainable code that scales.
